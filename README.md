My initial work for BEE Business

When I was given the opportunity to make a website for BEE Business. I started off by building this.

## What is it?
A project made in Larave v5.4. An initial starup to creating a full fledged website later.

## What does it do?
Nothing much. Just a simple login page and capabilites to add users and customize profile. Moving onto specifics:
- When a user requests for a password reset, an email is sent to him/her with a link to reset the passsword (kind of like how real systems work).
- When a new user is created, an email is sent to him/her with a link to create his/her account (cool huh...).
I implemented these features thinking that these are basic steps that this system will take (turned out to be different).

## Are you not using it?
Technically yes. But I didn't delete this project. Instead made a repository so that I can always look back on what I did.
